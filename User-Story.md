As a school administrator, I want to have a database management system that can store and manage student and staff information, so that I can easily access and update records as needed. 

As a teacher, I want to be able to view my students' academic records, attendance, and other relevant information, so that I can better understand their needs and provide appropriate support. 

Overall, the school database management system should be user-friendly, efficient, and customizable to meet the specific needs of the school and its users.
